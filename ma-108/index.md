I made these notes when I was appointed as a TA for this course (MA 108 - Ordinary Differential Equations.) 

Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this course had to be brought to an abrupt end. However, I believe that this is quite an important course and thus, students should still learn it. However, I understand that one may not feel motivated enough to go through all the [notes posted by the course instructor](http://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~preeti/ma108-2019/) and thus, I have written a compilation of my own.
