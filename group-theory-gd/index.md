The above presentation is what I had made for a group discussion conducted by the [Maths and Physics Club, IITB](https://mnp-club.github.io/).  

I used the above slides to introduce group theory. The presentation by itself might lack some details as I had the liberty to talk and explain things in a finer detail during the presentation.

If you are reading for the first time, it may be a good idea to use the slides with pauses.
