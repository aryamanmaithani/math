#### [Part 1](/math/posets/1.pdf) | [Part 2](/math/posets/2.pdf) | [TEX](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/math/tree/master/posets)
These were presentations I prepared for as additional reading under a professor. I also presented this at the [Student Seminar in Mathematics Department, IITB](https://student-seminar-math-iitb.github.io).

### Summary
The first presentation starts with an introduction about posets. We then see various objects related to posets such as rank-generating polynomials, order ideals, and antichains. We also see various operations that can be performed on posets.  
The second presentation starts an introduction about lattices. We then see move our attention to distributive lattices and prove the fundamental theorem of finite distributive lattices.
