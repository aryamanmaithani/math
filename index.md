Hi, here's where I post math stuff that I've written (in $$\LaTeX$$).  
With all my $$\LaTeX$$'d files, I also upload the source `.tex` code.  
To view those, you can go to the appropriate folder that you may find [here](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/math). (Mostly, just changing the `.pdf` to `.tex` in the URL works as well but sometimes I have split the document into many `.tex` codes.)

* [Numerical Analysis](ma-214)
* [Group theory GD](group-theory-gd)
<!-- * [ODEs](ma-108), a summary of the first undergraduate ODE course -->
* [MA 107 notes](ma-107)
* [Group theory notes](ma-419)
* [Category theory](cat-theory)
* [Posets](posets)
* [Infinities and beyond](infinities-and-beyond)
* [Classification of Surfaces](classification-of-surfaces), a topology report I made for the Summer of Science initiative by [MnP, IITB](https://mnp-club.github.io/).
