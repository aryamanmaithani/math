These are my notes on Galois theory, based on \href{https://nptel.ac.in/courses/111101001}{this NPTEL course}. It is assumed that the reader has taken a first course on group and ring theory. Some basic results are stated with proof in the next chapter, along with notations. 

I had wanted to make these notes (for my reference) as a way to collect the results in one place. Due to this, the proofs are all at the end. You can jump from a result to a proof (and back) using the hyperlinked arrows.

I would like to thank Ishan Kapnadak for pointing out numerous typos.
