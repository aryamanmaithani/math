After putting this off for a long time, I finally disjoint-ified the math and personal parts of my website. Hopefully no broken links were created out of this. I really like this theme ([Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/){:target="blank"}) and am quite glad with the overall look. Only thing left now is to place [my section on groups](https://aryamanmaithani.github.io/alg/groups/){:target="blank"} in some appropriate place.

Having a separate blog on this side of the website would also mean that I could potentially write some math blogs in the future, something I have wanted to do for a while.
