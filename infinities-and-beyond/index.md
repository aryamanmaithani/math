#### [PDF](/math/infinities-and-beyond/Infinities and beyond.pdf) | [TEX](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani/math/tree/master/infinities-and-beyond)  
The document contains some results and their proofs about cardinalities that I found interesting. The report is not self-contained in the sense that I don't define what cardinal numbers are and I skip proofs regarding their arithmetic.  
A nice thing about this document is that I keep track of which arguments use the Axiom of Choice and which ones don't.
